EX: 3

FILES:
JobContext.h -- header file containing the structs and ThreadContext and Job Context which is
related to the threads and the job.
Barrier.h -- The barrier header that was given in the EX3 resources.
Barrier.cpp -- The barrier implementation that was given in the EX3 resources.
MapReduceFramework.cpp -- The implementation of our program the MapReduceFramework.h
fileWordCounter_comparison.png -- the graph of MultiThreadingLevel vs. Time.
README -- this file.

REMARK:
In the fileWordCounter_comparison graph, we pay attention that after running our program on
FileWordCounter we usually  get around the same time each time even though we increase the number
of threads, this is due to the PC we are running our program on(Aquarium computer) and results
from our computer having (all the specs are written at the end of the file) we have 4
processors and so 4 cores where each core has 1 thread.

Question 1:
Since the program is cpu bounded it would result in the program being faster if the cpu is faster,
and so the optimal number would be as the machine's number of of cores since usually
each core contains  two hyper threads that run the program, and so the limitation here
is in the hardware and the optimal number is the number of the machine/computer threads.
Question 2:
a)
The line would be printed 2n times, which is reasonable since we have the fork function that
results in the code being duplicated into the father and the son, and so n threads would be
printed by the child threads and the other n would be printed by the father threads.

b)
Since we have 2n threads, n threads are created by the child and another n threads which are
created by the son,  and so we have n! options for the child and another n!.
and so we get (n!)^2 options in total
